## Description
Don't let the world get overrun by zombies!

ZombieSlayer is a simple browser-based overhead shooter game built entirely with JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas.

## Features
* Game mechanics built from the ground up, including collision detection, scoring, respawning, vitality, etc.
* Utilizes my own algorithm (work in progress) to find a safe spawn point after death
* Sprite-based drawings and animations done with HTML5 Canvas
* Some silly on-death effects to satisfy the bloodthirsty!
* Utilizes HTML5 Local Storage to keep a local leaderboard stored on the client's browser
